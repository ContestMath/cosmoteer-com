/ping: responds with the bot's latency

/com: Calculates the center of mass of a cosmoteer ship.png
- parameters:
 - ship: the .ship.png file of the ship. Usually found in C:\\Users\\UR USERNAME\\Saved Games\\Cosmoteer\\UR STEAM ID\\Saved Ships
 - boost: turns boosters on or off. Default: on
 - flipvectors: flips the thrust vectors to avoid overlap. Default: off
 - strafecot: draws the center of thrust vectors on every direction instead of only fordwards. Default: on
 - partcom: draws the center of mass of each part. Default: off
 - draw: draws the output image. Default: on

- common questions:
 - does the bot consider the 5% lateral thrust of each thruster? yes
 - does the bot consider engine room buff? yes
 - is the cot exact? it should be
 - is the com exact? no, it's a decent approximation, it should be inside the green circle
 - is the max speed exact? no, it's an approximation, assume Â±1%, and it assumes your ship is balanced

- If you notice any mistakes on things like the total mass or the speed, ping LunastroD"""
