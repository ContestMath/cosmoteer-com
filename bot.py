/help: Shows this message

common questions:
- does the bot consider the 5% lateral thrust? yes
- does the bot consider engine room buff? yes
- is the cot exact? it should be
- is the com exact? no, it's a decent approximation, it should be inside the green circle
- is the max speed exact? no, it's an approximation, assume Â±1%, and it assumes your ship is balanced
- are boosters on or off for the calculation of the cot? they are on

- If you notice any mistakes on things like the total mass or the speed, ping me
