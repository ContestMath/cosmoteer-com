- command arguments on the Bot
    - booster thrusters
    - disable strafe vectors
- make the bot more reliable
    - check if a ship is outside of the boundaries
    - check if it has unknown parts
    - why does the bot crash sometimes?
- optimize
    - save_tools could be faster
    - make a fast mode that represents the ship as fast as possible, maybe using pixels
