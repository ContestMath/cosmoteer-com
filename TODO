- command arguments on the Bot
    - booster thrusters
    - disable strafe vectors
- make the bot more reliable
    - check if a ship is outside of the boundaries
    - check if it has unknown parts
    - why does the bot crash sometimes?
- improve api
    - vector outlines?
- optimize
    - save_tools could be faster
    - make a fast mode that represents the ship as fast as possible, maybe using pixels
- 5% lateral thrust of each thruster

- ask this:
    hi! I made this to predict the max speed of a ship. It's very very close but not quite there. It predicts a couple m/s more. Is there anything wrong with my formula?

    def top_speed(mass,thrust):
        speed=0
        for i in range(100):
            drag=max(speed / 75, 1)*2 speed * 0.4
            acceleration=thrust/mass-drag
            speed=speed+acceleration/30
        return speed
